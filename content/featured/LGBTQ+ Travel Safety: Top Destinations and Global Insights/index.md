Here's my dashboard on LGBTQ+ travel safety and rights. It highlights the safest destinations for gay travelers, showing key stats like safety rankings, legal status, and LGBT marketing efforts. You can filter by year, legality, and number of countries to get a clear view of how things change over time. It's a quick way to see where LGBTQ+ travelers are most welcome and how different factors, like religion and laws, affect their safety globally.
