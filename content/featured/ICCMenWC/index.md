Here's my ICC Men’s World Cup 2023 dashboard ,it's all the key stats in one place. I have put together the highest 50s, 100s, those massive 6s and 4s, and some cool bowling stats to show who’s really on top. It’s designed so you can quickly see the highlights and track all the standout performances as they happen.
