The paper "Cowpea Leaf Disease Identification Using Deep Learning" presents a deep learning-based system to classify cowpea leaf diseases, utilizing six models, with the Vision Transformer (ViT) achieving the highest accuracy of 96%. The research involves creating a dataset of 5,100 images and applying image augmentation techniques for improved performance. The ViT model accurately predicts three common cowpea diseases and provides recommendations for treatment and prevention. This solution aims to help farmers with early disease detection and better crop management, ultimately improving yield and plant health.
