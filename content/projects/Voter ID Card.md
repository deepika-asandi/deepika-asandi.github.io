Worked on the ideation and creation of a fully funded project called Voter ID Card and fingerprint-based E-voting system. This is a system that conducts elections using UID and fingerprint of the voter. This system ensures safe and secure elections. Co-authored a paper on the same at the International Conference on Inventive Computation and Information Technologies (ICICIT),(Database Management,Raspberry Pi, Python, IoT, Web Development)
