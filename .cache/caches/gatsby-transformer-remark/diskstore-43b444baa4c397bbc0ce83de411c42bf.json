The research involves creating a dataset of 5,100 images and applying image augmentation techniques for improved performance. The ViT model accurately predicts three common cowpea diseases and provides recommendations for treatment and prevention. This solution aims to help farmers with early disease detection and better crop management, ultimately improving yield and plant health.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":619,"offset":668}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":619,"offset":668}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":669}}}}
