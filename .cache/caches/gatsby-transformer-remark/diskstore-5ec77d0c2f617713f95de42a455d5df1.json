I'm Sai Deepika Asandi, based in Boston and a Data Analytics grad student at Tufts with a GPA of 3.9, combining my love for data with hands-on learning. I’m currently interning with the MBTA, where I build data pipelines and create dashboards to enhance operational insights. At Tufts, I work as a Teaching Assistant, guiding students through Python, machine learning, and analytics.</p>\n<p>My research journey has been both challenging and rewarding—from analyzing transportation data at Tufts to leading projects at HuT Labs, like autonomous vehicle lane segmentation and a voter ID and fingerprint-based e-voting system, which I published with IEEE. I also competed in IDC Robocon 2021 and 2022, collaborating internationally on robotics.</p>\n<p>When I’m not diving into data, I’m usually lost in a good book, dancing, or exploring new perspectives through stories.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!</p>"}
